and scared. I grew up and am now raising two children in the most wealthy and powerful nation in the
history of humanity. A country that has fought and won two world wars, put humans on the moon, has enough firepower to
destroy the world multiple of times over, and invent, create, and manufacture technological achievements that until
recently would have been considered the things of fiction. Despite all of this, as a parent, I no longer feel comfortable
about leaving my children with places that are supposed to be safe places for them. No longer do I have confidence in
our institutions keep our loved ones safe.</p>
<p>Why do I feel this way? Just days ago, an individual walked into a school in Uvalde, TX and killed 21 people, including
19 students. Crazily enough, this was only a little more than a week from another mass shooting in Buffalo, NY where 10
people were killed in a supermarket. As a parent, it’s definitely an understatement to say that I concerned with the
safety of my children, especially when they are at places that are supposed to be considered safe and secure. More
specifically, I am talking about their safety when in schools, stores, malls, and other places where you don’t really
imagine an unthinkable event such as a mass shooting occurring. While my kids are not old enough to be in a public school
system, one is getting close and extremely concerned about sending them into school. And of course, they do accompany me
to other places where these events occur.</p>
<p>As an aside, yes, you can tell me all about the statistic that says how unlikely it is that my child is going to be a
victim in a school shooting. I will tell you to shove it and offer that if my child is one of those statistics, I
certainly won’t get any comfort in the fact that my child was just unlucky and go on with my day. In other words, I
don’t like gambling when it comes to the lives of my child, especially when confronted with something that is avoidable.
In 2018, there were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd/index.html">288 school shootings in the US</a>
versus 45 combined occurrences among 18 countries. I’m sure its gotten worse. We can argue data all day but regardless,
all data shows that there is an issue with gun violence and mass shootings, and that issue is that it has become much
more dangerous to be a child in school or to take your family out to the store, park, or other seemingly harmless event.
On top of that, this is a problem exclusive to the United States. Yes, other nations do have occurrences. Unfortunately,
those are rare occurrences in every other country when compared to the United States. Perhaps I will post a more
empirical post with actual stats and all that. But that is not this post.</p>
<p>Right now, as I write this, there are more details coming out but they all seem to point to a couple of nightmarish
details:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An individual with bad intentions was able to get their hands on weapons (specifically, an AR-15 with a high-capacity
magazine and a handgun, although I have not seen this recognized). Regardless of how they got it, it was readily
available enough for them to get access to it and use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Said individual was able to defeat barricades (i.e. he climbed a fence) and enter the school unopposed after shooting
his grandmother, crashing his vehicle in front of the school, and shooting at people at a building near the school
(earlier reports indicated that there was a school resource officer that engaged with the individual but that appears to
now be false. There was actually no officer on duty at the school at this time). In other words, the security the school
had in place was either ineffective or not being used, at least to a point to prevent said individual from gaining
access and committing the atrocious acts that he did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law enforcement officials arrived on-scene, engaged with the individual, backed away from individual, then took cover
and called and waited for back-up. It appears that the armed authorities waited 40 to 60 minutes before clearing the
school. Actually, it appears that responding officers stood by for a border patrol tactical team to arrive and clear the
school. During this time, they ignored pleas of desperate parents asking them to stop the shooter and even went as far
as actively preventing said parents from attempting to enter the school zone or connect with their children. Prevention
measures included tackling a dad attempting to enter the school, tasing a parent attempting to enter the evacuation
holding area, and pepper spraying a parent who was arguing with the police.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I completely agree that the person who committed this atrocious act is completely responsible for this. We can shout
from the rooftops and tell everyone that this person is horrible, evil, the absolute worst of us. And for this
individual, that is all we can do because he was killed when engaging with the police when they finally reentered the
school (rightfully so - I have no arguments with the police using deadly force to eliminate this individual). There is
no punishment to be issued for him because he is gone, along with the innocent lives he took. With that, I’m not going
to go into this individual’s lives, background, or motivations because there are going to be so many articles and pieces
ripping him apart and attempting to rationalize why he did what he did. Then, it will be added to the hundreds of other
profiles that we have compiled on similar cases and forget about it. So go read those if you want to know about the
murderer.</p>
<p>Instead, what I want to highlight is what I believe is the actual root cause - the failing of various institutions that
are supposed to protect our society. These institutions have been rotting for quite some time (or maybe they were never
there, it was just an illusion that is now starting to shatter). This post won’t go into when or how it started. For
this point, it doesn’t matter. Regardless, the rot is here and has permeated into so many pillars of American society
that it now appears that they can no longer ensure the safety of our most innocent lives. In fact, I would argue that
the rot has grown so deep that these institutions do not view protecting society as a priority and are instead focused
on other things (which I’m not going to attempt to go into here).</p>
<p>First things first, as a society, we do not bear arms responsibly. I say this as someone who does own firearms. To me,
bearing a firearm responsibly means securing the weapon safely when storing it and using it in a way that is not meant
to harm another person (excluding self-defense). Despite my view of this and regardless of all the training available,
an individual can go to a store and purchase a weapon with no prior experience or training. In fact, they could have the
worst of intentions or be extremely disturbed and still get a weapon designed for military use and to hold a large amount
of bullets. The obvious evidence are the occurrence of mass shootings. The less obvious evidence is the countless violent
crime, suicide, and incidental death that occurs from the perpetrator or victim having access to a firearm (note the
exclusion of perpetrator AND victim - oftentimes, the victim is the one who discharged the firearm, such as in suicides
or accidental discharges). To be clear, I am talking about armed robberies, jealous spouses, gang violence, suicide,
minors accidentally discharging weapons into others or themselves, and other instances that occur much more frequently
than mass shootings. While we can argue all day that each one of these things have unique challenges to overcome, they
can all be stopped if each of the individual’s access to firearms is eliminated. There is no argument that can stand
against the brunt of evidence from other countries that have instituted gun control. We can talk about philosophy,
rights, and “what about”-isms but there is no hard evidence that points to firearms making our society safer with
firearms than similar societies being less safe without firearms. In fact, the opposite is true - societies without
firearms are far and away safer than our society with firearms. And if there is hard evidence, it is really only applies
in select occurrences that are too narrow to really apply to society as a whole. Or it is dependent on an extremely
controlled scenario (for example, yes, perhaps that elderly woman could have fought off her robbers if she had a firearm.
Perhaps she could have also killed innocent bystanders because she didn’t have the training). Contrary to what
politicians and commentators bark to their constituents and viewers, if the United States did not allow their citizens
to be armed, Uvalde and a vast majority of other mass shootings, violent crime, and other gun crime and accidents would
not have happened.</p>
<p>Next, as a society, we have placed the individual first and foremost. “I” comes before neighbors, before friends, before
family, and apparently even before our spouse and children. This is evident in many aspects of our society (as shown
most recently by anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and those opposing the recent 2020 presidential elections) but for this post,
I will use the preceding paragraph to highlight this. Apparently as a society, we are willing to sacrifice our children
and other innocent lives as long as it means that we have unfettered access to firearms. We know what needs to happen
and what needs to be done, but we are unwilling to do it, regardless of the cost of innocent lives that are sacrificed
each and every year to keep our right to bear arms. To be fair, we are pulling the trigger. But it’s not as easy to
always say that a bad person is pulling the trigger - look at the occurrence of suicides and accidental discharge
(accidental discharge of firearms are now the leading cause of death in children). And as a society, even though we know
that bad people will get their hands on firearms and will use them on innocents, we are still seemingly ok with it. For
that, we should bear some responsibility for that mentality. And I don’t understand what we get from it anymore. Maybe
it’s the illusion of safety that firearms bring (despite armed people in society, it’s just not true that it makes
society any safer. In fact, the “good guy with a gun” does prove to be a fallacy and often times makes bystanders less
safe. Heck, even the “good guy” is less safe when the cops roll in and take out the “good guy” before they understand
the situation), maybe we like feeling tough and powerful (again, “good guy with a gun” has proven to be a fallacy), or
maybe we just like to shoot firearms as a pastime. Whatever it is, we as a society have decided our individual right to
bear firearms is worth the sacrifice of innocent lives we witness to maintain it. Actually, not only to maintain that
right, but to go as far as to ensure that access is guaranteed to all citizens, including the most disturbed among us
(as long as they don’t have any felonies, which really doesn’t matter because those laws does little to prevent them
from getting access to firearms as well).</p>
<p>Lastly but certainly not least, those who are “sworn” to protect us and our loved ones, simply don’t anymore. And now,
it appears that they will go as far as to prevent us from protecting our loved ones. For this situation, I’m not going
to be so naive to say that if the cops allowed the parents into the school, then everything would have been ok. In fact,
I’ll concede that if the parents were allowed in, then perhaps more lives would have been lost. However, a guaranteed
way to ensure that lives are lost is to do nothing and then actively prevent other from doing something. I used to think
that those who wear a badge were there to protect us and our loved ones, but I’m not so sure anymore. The witness accounts
of the behavior and performance of the police who responded to the shooting are disturbing. They engaged with the
individual and appear to have backed away from the classroom, deciding to call and wait for backup, which appears to have
taken 40 to 60 minutes. Despite being armed with AR-15s themselves (pictures of cops arguing with parents do show that
they and AR-15s… and don’t get in a tussy with me using the term AR-15. No, it was probably not an AR-15 but it most
certainly is in the style of it. I own one myself), they needed to get negotiators and tactical teams on-sight to
properly engage the individual. Then, they had to get an attendant to unlock the door (apparently that was the only way
in that could allow to engage the perpetrator) because either police can’t break down doors anymore or the doors are so
strong that they are great at locking dangerous people in with our kids. By the time they did enter and take out the
murderer, 19 students and 2 teachers were dead. Of course, they did take action against the unarmed parents trying to
motivate action from the bystanding cops, or even taking action against the parents themselves as they attempted to do
anything to respond to the shooter. I can’t blame the parents. If my child was unaccounted for while I saw those who swear
to protect my children running away from my child’s live threat and then waiting for armed backup when they themselves
outnumber and outarm the perpetrator, I would also be extremely motivated to take action myself. I hope that I would be
like that dad who got tackled. After all, if they are not going to protect my child, then obviously the only one left to
do so is myself. And it highlights a major problem when said protectors are now taking no (or at best minimal) action to
prevent or eliminate the threat but also prevent the parent from doing so.</p>
<p>And I think that really shows the crux of the issue. We are regressing as a society. To the point of this post, I’m not
going to go into why or how I think we got to this point (but they are important topics themselves). Really, the topic
is that we are regressing to a point where we are no longer viewing society as a collective community that we compromise
and act with cohesion on to ensure that we are all protected and taken care of, at least to the best of our ability.
Instead, we are starting to morph into a community of tribes living among other tribes. We view those who don’t agree
with our views as enemies, data and truth that does not agree with our reality as “fake”, and ultimately this boils
down to a society that does not protect each other along with a government that is failing at its most basic
responsibility - protecting the lives of its constituents. Each one of the above points is glaringly evident in the
above points presented by Uvalde. To highlight plain and simple, parents are now fighting against cops in an attempt to
try to rescue them from an armed lunatic in a place where they are supposed to be safe and learning.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer? Are we as individuals now responsible with ensuring the protection of our loved ones? How do we do
that if we send them to school or are out in an apparently unsafe public in a society that is unwilling to give up
firearms? And now, what if those charged wih our protection not only fail to do so, but take no action and go so far as
to prevent parents from doing so. As a dad with two young children, how in the hell do I ensure that they are safe in
this society?</p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack here. There are so many data points and references that I could provide but really, this is me
ranting as a dad who is extremely disturbed, frightened, and having a hard time to process what has transpired over the
last few days, especially as details come out. Nineteen children are now dead regardless of the fact that they were in
a place deemed “safe and secure” and surrounded by “highly trained” and heavily armed police officers. I’m hoping I can
use this anger to attempt to do something to make this society safer for my children, even though it will probably be
futile with how our society views our right to bear firearms and the lack of political will to enact any law or
legislation. Anyways, I’ve realized that the issue is not going to go away and in fact, it is only going to get worse if
the current trend is any indication. It’s time for us to do something and, if I can figure out what that means for me,
I’m going to do it.</p></section><hr/><footer><div class="bio"><p>Articles about techy experiments, games and hobbies, and the society they and their family live in.<!-- --> <a href="https://twitter.com/mupsys">Also, feel free to follow on Twitter!</a></p></div></footer></article><nav class="blog-post-nav"><ul style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;list-style:none;padding:0"><li></li><li></li></ul></nav></main><footer>Thanks for visiting!</footer></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/angry-terrified-parent/";window.___webpackCompilationHash="60ff6344f1243327c1ba";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-67664a8ccc6c9f02b880.js"],"app":["/app-65fe2d3b2dfc305924fb.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-27981ca7dd461cb4280e.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-b96844d44d9f4ab181ff.js"],"component---src-pages-using-typescript-tsx":["/component---src-pages-using-typescript-tsx-2f9b97cf148785549d09.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-9fb8e9a3391dbfc44ab9.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-67664a8ccc6c9f02b880.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/app-65fe2d3b2dfc305924fb.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-cd9ba813abf39352e631.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-d61b3b05e97b6d7f845c.js" async=""></script></body></html>
